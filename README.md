# Super Metroid Map Tracker Pack
This is a map & item tracker for the Super Metroid item randomizer for use with [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net).  It has full item and map tracking support, as well as autotracking on supported platforms. It is based on the Super Metroid DASH Map Tracker pack. This version just removes DASH logic and can highlight major/minor item locations.

## Thanks
[SauceRelic](https://github.com/SauceRelic) - Created the map/item tracker pack for the old Tewtal SM item randomizer, which was the basis for the DASH randomizer.  That pack was in turn the basis for this new pack specifically for the DASH rando, so huge thanks!
